# Projects from CS61B: Data Structures

## Bear Maps
We created a web mapping application inspired by Google Maps by working with real-world mapping data. Our project was focused on implementind the back end: the web server that powers the API that the front end makes requests to.

## Build Your Own Game (BYOG)
We designed and implemented a 2D tile-based game. Our game is revolved around the culture at UC Berkeley, specifically Sproul Plaza. Appropriately named "Escape from Sproul", your goal is to make it out of Sproul Plaza and to your class without losing all of your morale. 

Here are our rules:
- To successfully leave, you must get at least one internship offer by talking to the people on Sproul. 
- But wait! It's possible that the people aren't actually recruiters--they're just pesky students flyering for you to join their club! If it's just a student, you lose 1 morale point. If your morale levels reach 0, you dejectedly go home and don't make it to class (ya lose!).
- You can up your morale by petting fluffy doggos from the De-Stress with Dogs club.
- Once you've secured your internship offer, talk to Professor Hug so he can bless you with the key to success.
- With the key to success and an internship, you can finally leave Sproul and go to your next class. Wow!
